# Library Management App

This is an application built for a fictional system of Library branches. It lets employees manage library assets and patron information, allowing them to check books or videos in and out. I built it using .NET to get a little more practice with MVC as well as to explore a new set of backend technology as I mostly use NodeJS, and it was a good experience.

You can see it in action [here](https://jamesquillin.github.io) in my portfolio where I have a clip of it.

## Running the App

To get it up and running, clone the code and then open it up in Visual Studio. From there you can compile and run the code just as you would with any other solution. There are no special dependencies outside of the .NET framework so everything should be included in the program solution.
